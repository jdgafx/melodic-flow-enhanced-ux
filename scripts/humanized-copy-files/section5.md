Stay​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ online without turning your phone into a second home. Genuine posts for genuine people.

Consistent Social Presence

Stay online without spending all day on your phone. We make it three posts a week, real photos and captions that begin the conversations. It needs your brand to be top-of-mind and your followers to be loyal.

We understand. You want to see some success without being glued to your phone. So here's the idea:

- 20 posts a month, and they really sound like you. No stiff corporate speak here.

- We manage LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, and X, basically all of them.

- Customized visuals—and yes, no more horrible pictures of two men shaking hands in boardrooms.

- The hashtags are actually selected to bring you new people and not just words thrown together without meaning.

- We also drop by comments, reply to people and develop the community with your brand at the center.

- At the beginning of the month, you get a report that dissects the work behind the success. Just the data that really counts.

We also prepare and schedule your content.

What possibly questions come up in your mind?

So, what platforms should you actually consider being present on?

Honestly, it is basically dependent on your product service. A restaurant in the neighborhood? Well, you're definitely better off on Instagram and Google Business rather than LinkedIn, that's just common sense, right? We pinpoint for you the places where your customers spend their time.

Will I have the chance to preview the posts before they are published?

Of course, it's totally fine. Every month, you'll have a content calendar in your hands. You go through it, approve it, tell us what changes need to be made—we won't hit publish without your confirmation, I mean it.

Could you handle posting from my account?

Yes, we can if you decide to give us the access. Or we just deliver the content to you and you post it. To be honest, whatever is your comfort zone, no pressure at all.

What if I want something different in the content?

Don't worry about it, we'll change it. Usually, it's one or two rounds before you get your voice right, so we'll keep tweaking with you until it is really your brand.

Are You Posting...

One restaurant client said to us: "I kept meaning to post and then I didn't. Now my Instagram actually looks ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌alive."
