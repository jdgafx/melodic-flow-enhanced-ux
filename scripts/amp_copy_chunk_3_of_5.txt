Here's something that keeps us up at night: most businesses waste a massive chunk of their ad budget—sometimes 30-50%—on copy that totally misses the mark. That's crazy, right? So here's how we tackle things:
[/BLOCK-ad-copy-04]

[BLOCK-ad-copy-05] (BULLET POINT)
We create 4-8 headline variations for each ad set and let the testing do its thing.

How do you know if it's working?
[/BLOCK-ad-copy-19]
