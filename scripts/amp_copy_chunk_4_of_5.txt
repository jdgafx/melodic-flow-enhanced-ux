Turn visitors into customers 24/7. AI-powered lead capture across website, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[/BLOCK-lead-funnel-01]

[BLOCK-lead-funnel-02] (PAGE COPY)
Most lead funnels are broken. They either ask for too much info too soon, or they just drop leads into a black hole. We build funnels that actually convert strangers into booked appointments.

[/BLOCK-lead-funnel-03]

[BLOCK-lead-funnel-04] (PAGE COPY)
We build funnels that actually work—you know, the kind that turn strangers into booked appointments on your calendar. Here's how we roll:
[/BLOCK-lead-funnel-04]

[BLOCK-lead-funnel-05] (BULLET POINT)
We start by creating something your ideal customers actually want—maybe it's a checklist, a guide, or a calculator. Something they can't resist downloading.
[/BLOCK-lead-funnel-05]

[BLOCK-lead-funnel-06] (BULLET POINT)
Then we build you a landing page that actually converts. We're talking 20% or better. Most agencies get excited about 5%—we shoot way higher.
[/BLOCK-lead-funnel-06]

[BLOCK-lead-funnel-07] (BULLET POINT)
Next, we set up email sequences that don't feel robotic. These emails warm up your leads automatically until they're ready to talk.
[/BLOCK-lead-funnel-07]

[BLOCK-lead-funnel-08] (BULLET POINT)
We connect everything to your calendar so qualified prospects can book time with you directly—no back-and-forth email chains.
[/BLOCK-lead-funnel-08]

[BLOCK-lead-funnel-09] (BULLET POINT)
And yeah, we track all of it. You'll know exactly which pieces are working and which ones we need to tweak.

[/BLOCK-lead-funnel-13]

[BLOCK-lead-funnel-18] (FAQ QUESTION)
How is this different from the chatbot I already have?
[/BLOCK-lead-funnel-18]

[BLOCK-lead-funnel-19] (FAQ ANSWER)
Look, most chatbots just answer basic questions and stop there. Ours actually sells. It figures out if someone's a good fit, gets their contact info, and books them on your calendar—all automatically. One of our clients said their old bot felt like talking to a vending machine. Ours? Like having their best sales rep pulling night shifts.
[/BLOCK-lead-funnel-19]

[BLOCK-lead-funnel-20] (FAQ QUESTION)
What happens if I already use a CRM?
[/BLOCK-lead-funnel-20]

[BLOCK-lead-funnel-21] (FAQ ANSWER)
Good question—we plug into pretty much everything. HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, Zoho, you name it. Every chat, every detail, drops right into your existing setup. Your team sees the full conversation so leads never have to repeat themselves.
[/BLOCK-lead-funnel-21]

[BLOCK-lead-funnel-22] (FAQ QUESTION)
Facebook Messenger sounds complicated. Is it?
[/BLOCK-lead-funnel-22]

[BLOCK-lead-funnel-23] (FAQ ANSWER)
Not at all—that's our job. Here's what actually happens: someone DMs your Facebook page at 3am. Your bot replies instantly (yes, instantly), asks a few quick questions to qualify them, and if they're a fit, offers to book a call. They pick a time from your calendar, done. You wake up to a booked meeting. Pretty sweet.
[/BLOCK-lead-funnel-23]

[BLOCK-lead-funnel-24] (FAQ QUESTION)
I have tried LinkedIn automation before and it felt spammy.
[/BLOCK-lead-funnel-24]

[BLOCK-lead-funnel-25] (FAQ ANSWER)
Yeah, we get that. Those tools spamming everyone with the same generic message? Total garbage—and they ruin LinkedIn for everyone. We do it differently. We find people who actually fit your ideal profile, engage with their posts like real humans (actual thoughtful comments, not just 'great post!'), and start real conversations. Think warm intros, not cold spam.
[/BLOCK-lead-funnel-25]

[BLOCK-lead-funnel-26] (FAQ QUESTION)
How long until I see results?
[/BLOCK-lead-funnel-26]

[BLOCK-lead-funnel-27] (FAQ ANSWER)
Depends on your traffic, honestly. Most folks see their first solid lead within the first week though. The cool part? The system learns what works best for your specific business and gets better over time. By week three or four, you'll usually have a steady flow coming in without lifting a finger.
[/BLOCK-lead-funnel-27]

[BLOCK-lead-funnel-28] (FAQ QUESTION)
What if I need changes after launch?
[/BLOCK-lead-funnel-28]

[BLOCK-lead-funnel-29] (FAQ ANSWER)
First 30 days? Totally free for whatever tweaks you need. After that, we bill hourly at reasonable rates. We're not those guys who vanish after launch—if you need something changed, you get it. Truth is, most clients stay because this stuff actually works, not because they're stuck in some contract.

The Number One Reason Leads Get Lost
[/BLOCK-lead-funnel-30]

[BLOCK-lead-funnel-31] (PAGE COPY)
Response time. A lead that doesn't get a reply within 5 minutes is 10x less likely to convert. That's just how people work—they move on, forget, find a competitor.
[/BLOCK-lead-funnel-31]

[BLOCK-lead-funnel-32] (PAGE COPY)
One gym owner we worked with put it simply: "I used to lose 5 to 10 leads a week because I couldn't respond fast enough. Now I wake up to appointments already booked on my calendar."
