[BLOCK-social-media-13] (FAQ QUESTION)
So, which platforms should you actually be on?
[/BLOCK-social-media-13]

[BLOCK-social-media-14] (FAQ ANSWER)
Honestly, it depends on what you do. A local restaurant? Yeah, you're way better off on Instagram and Google Business than LinkedIn—that's just common sense, right? We help you zero in on where your customers actually spend their time.

Do I get to see posts before they go live?
[/BLOCK-social-media-15]

[BLOCK-social-media-16] (FAQ ANSWER)
Absolutely. You'll get a content calendar every month. Review it, give it the thumbs up, tell us what needs changing—we're not hitting publish without your say-so, promise.
[/BLOCK-social-media-16]

[BLOCK-social-media-17] (FAQ QUESTION)
Can you post from my account?
[/BLOCK-social-media-17]

[BLOCK-social-media-18] (FAQ ANSWER)
Yeah, we can if you want to hand over access. Or we can just send you the content and you post it yourself. Honestly, whatever you're comfortable with—no pressure here at all.
[/BLOCK-social-media-18]

[BLOCK-social-media-19] (FAQ QUESTION)
What if I need changes to the content?
[/BLOCK-social-media-19]

[BLOCK-social-media-20] (FAQ ANSWER)
No worries, we'll tweak it. Sometimes it takes a round or two to really nail your voice, so we'll keep working with you until it actually feels like your brand.
