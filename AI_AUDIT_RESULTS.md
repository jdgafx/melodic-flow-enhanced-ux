## HUMANIZATION TECHNIQUES TO APPLY

### For High-Risk Pages:

1. **Replace Formal Terms:**
   - "ensure" → "make sure"
   - "implement" → "set up"
   - "optimize" → "fix up"
   - "leverage" → "use"
   - "utilize" → "use"
   - "extensive" → "a lot of"
   - "seamlessly" → delete
   - "intelligent" → "smart"

2. **Add Contractions:**
   - "do not" → "don't"
   - "will not" → "won't"
   - "it is" → "it's"
   - "we are" → "we're"

3. **Break Patterns:**
   - Vary sentence starters
   - Mix short and long sentences
   - Use fragments for emphasis
   - Add rhetorical questions

4. **Add Personal Touches:**
